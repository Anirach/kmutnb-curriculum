# Public User Logout Fix - Loading Screen Issue

## Problem Description
Public users were getting stuck on a loading screen that shows "กำลังตรวจสอบการเข้าสู่ระบบ..." (Checking login status...) when clicking the logout button (ออกจากระบบ).

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was caused by a conflict between multiple state management layers:

1. **Dashboard Component**: When `user` is set to `null`, Dashboard shows a loading screen instead of navigating away
2. **CurriculumApp**: The `isAuthenticated` state might still be `true` even after clearing the user
3. **State Timing**: The delay between clearing state and navigation allowed the app to get stuck in an inconsistent state

## Solution Implementation
Modified the logout logic in `/src/components/dashboard/Header.tsx` to:

1. **Immediate State Clearing**: Clear all localStorage and sessionStorage immediately
2. **No Delays**: Remove all timeouts and delays 
3. **Complete Reset**: Use `localStorage.clear()` instead of removing individual items
4. **Immediate Navigation**: Redirect to `/` immediately without showing toast messages

```typescript
if (isPublicUser) {
  // For public users, immediately clear everything and redirect
  console.log('Public user logout - immediate redirect');
  
  // Clear everything immediately
  setUser(null);
  localStorage.clear();
  sessionStorage.clear();
  
  // Immediate redirect without any delay
  window.location.href = '/';
  return;
}
```

## Why This Works
- **Prevents State Conflicts**: By clearing everything immediately, there's no chance for inconsistent state
- **Avoids Loading Screen**: The immediate redirect prevents the Dashboard from rendering its loading state
- **Complete Reset**: Full page navigation ensures all React state is reset
- **No Timing Issues**: No delays mean no intermediate states that could cause problems

## Testing Instructions
1. Navigate to the landing page
2. Click "สืบค้นข้อมูลหลักสูตร" to enter as public user
3. Wait for dashboard to load
4. Click "ออกจากระบบ" button
5. Should immediately redirect to landing page without getting stuck

## Expected Result
- Immediate redirect to landing page
- No loading screen or stuck state
- Both access buttons available on landing page
- Clean slate for next user interaction

## Files Modified
- `/src/components/dashboard/Header.tsx` - Updated public user logout logic
